## Why Brands Choose Contra Collective

### Technical Depth at Enterprise Scale
Our team combines deep platform expertise with systems thinking. We've architected commerce solutions handling millions in transaction volume, complex multi-region deployments, and sophisticated integration landscapes that most agencies avoid.

### Platform Specialization
We don't generalize. Our specialists possess deep, hands-on expertise in specific platforms:

- **Shopify Plus**: Custom app development, Storefront API implementations, headless architectures, and migrations from legacy platforms. We understand Plus at the edge cases—high-frequency order processing, marketplace integrations, advanced permission models.

- **Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)**: Enterprise-grade cartridge development, platform optimization, and backend integrations. We navigate SFCC's architectural complexity and deliver solutions that scale with enterprise growth.

- **Headless Commerce**: Decoupled architectures that decouple content, commerce logic, and presentation. We build with Next.js, Svelte, and React frontends backed by Sanity, Contentful, or custom content orchestration.

### Systems Integration Expertise
Enterprise brands face complex technical landscapes. We unify:

- **ERP Systems**: NetSuite, Netsuite OpenAir, Oracle Commerce, SAP Commerce Cloud integrations
- **Order Management Platforms (OMS)**: Custom OMS implementation and commerce platform synchronization

## Why Enterprise Brands Partner With Contra Collective

### Problem: Commodity Agency Solutions Don't Scale
Most agencies deliver surface-level solutions. They build storefronts that work for low-complexity use cases but collapse under enterprise requirements: high transaction volume, complex integrations, multi-region deployments, regulatory compliance.

### Our Difference
We think in systems. We understand:
- **Architecture consequences**: How platform choices affect scalability, performance, and long-term maintenance costs
- **Integration complexity**: ERP, OMS, 3PL, and accounting system orchestration requires systems thinking, not template solutions
- **Operational excellence**: Observability, monitoring, alerting, and incident response are built in, not afterthoughts
- **Business impact**: Technical decisions connect to revenue, customer experience, and operational efficiency

### Proven Expertise
Our team has architected:
- Commerce platforms handling millions of orders annually
- Complex system integrations unifying 5+ enterprise systems
- High-performance storefronts serving millions of monthly visitors
- Zero-downtime platform migrations from legacy systems
- Real-time inventory and order synchronization across channels and warehouses

## Services by Business Type

### For High-Volume Merchants
Growth brings complexity. Your Shopify Plus store handles millions in orders annually, but your systems weren't built for scale.

**We solve**: Platform optimization, inventory synchronization, order routing complexity, payment processing at volume, fraud detection, real-time reporting.

### For Enterprise Brands
You run multiple commerce channels—web, mobile, marketplace, wholesale. You need unified commerce logic, shared inventory, and complex approval workflows.

**We solve**: Headless architecture enabling channel independence, master data management, complex order workflows, multi-entity governance, real-time reporting.

### For Brands Managing Legacy Systems
Your commerce platform works, but it's brittle. Maintenance costs consume engineering resources. You're considering replacement or modernization.

**We solve**: Strategic migrations to modern platforms (Shopify Plus, SFCC, headless), parallel run architectures reducing risk, data migration and validation, post-launch optimization.

### For Brands with Complex Integrations
You're tied to legacy ERP systems, custom OMS implementations, or niche fulfillment providers. Your commerce platform is just one piece of a larger puzzle.

**We solve**: Custom integration architecture, middleware development, event-driven system design, data synchronization, conflict resolution and orchestration.

## Our Approach to Enterprise Partnerships

**1. Discovery & Architecture**
We don't start with proposals. We deeply understand your business, your technical landscape, your constraints. We design architecture first—implementation follows clear technical direction.

**2. Hands-On Execution**
We're not a management layer. Our senior engineers write code, architect systems, and own technical decisions. No intermediaries between strategy and implementation.

**3. Knowledge Transfer**
Your team should understand the systems we build. We invest in documentation, pairing sessions, and architectural clarity so you can maintain and evolve platforms long-term.

**4. Long-Term Partnership**
We're not a project vendor. We work with ambitious brands building their technical capabilities. Some of our strongest relationships span years, evolving as your business grows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does an e-commerce platform implementation take?
**Timeline depends on complexity and scope.** Shopify Plus custom app development typically spans 2-6 months. SFCC implementations (with existing infrastructure) span 4-8 months. Headless commerce builds depend on content architecture and integrations (3-6 months typical). We provide detailed timeline estimates during discovery.

### What's the difference between Shopify Plus and Salesforce Commerce Cloud?
**Shopify Plus** is SaaS-based commerce, excellent for brands prioritizing speed-to-market and operational simplicity. **SFCC** is a platform requiring deeper customization, better for enterprises with complex requirements (B2B, sophisticated approvals, custom pricing). We'll guide you toward the right platform for your specific use case.

### Can you migrate from [legacy platform] to Shopify Plus / SFCC / Headless?
**Yes.** We've migrated from Magento, custom builds, WooCommerce, and proprietary platforms. Migration strategy depends on data complexity, downtime tolerance, and timeline constraints. We typically employ parallel-run architectures to minimize risk.

### How do you handle system integration complexity?
**Systems thinking.** We design integration architecture upfront, not as an afterthought. We use event-driven patterns (Pub/Sub, webhooks), custom middleware, and orchestration layers. Most complexity comes from unclear data ownership and governance—we help establish this clarity.

### What's the cost range for enterprise e-commerce development?
**Costs vary dramatically.** Shopify Plus custom development runs $50K-$500K+ depending on scope. SFCC implementations span $200K-$2M+ including platform licensing. Headless commerce depends entirely on feature scope and integrations. We provide detailed estimates after discovery.

### Do you provide ongoing support post-launch?
**Yes.** We offer retainer partnerships covering maintenance, optimization, platform updates, and new feature development. Many clients engage us for 6-24 months post-launch, evolving platforms as business requirements change.

### How do you ensure systems remain maintainable long-term?
**Documentation, clarity, and knowledge transfer are non-negotiable.** We invest in comprehensive architecture documentation, codebase documentation, operational runbooks, and pairing sessions ensuring your team can maintain systems independently.

### What if we're currently with another agency?
**We can help.** We've taken over projects mid-implementation when initial partners couldn't deliver. We focus on understanding existing work, filling gaps, and establishing clear technical direction moving forward.
